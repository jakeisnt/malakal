* Malakal

Malakal is a day planner application. I crafted it because I was not able to find a comfortable calendar application for Linux. I myself have been using it daily for around half a year.

* Features

Core features:

- quickly add and modify events
- notify on events
- storage using standard ical files

UI/UX features:

- snapping mode and precision mode
- click to edit event
- undo modifications
- drag on blank to create events
- drag on an event to change its begin/end time or move the event
- ctrl-drag on an event to clone it
- calendar view for quick jumping to dates
- current date/time indicator

Typical calendar features that are not supported by malakal:

- synchronization/webdav: for now, you can use vdirsync for synchronization
- command line query: malakal happily shares local ical files with [[https://github.com/pimutils/khal][khal]]
- recurrent events: it may add a lot of complexity so it's not currently planned

* Installation

If you have rust on your computer, you can type:

#+begin_src
cargo install malakal
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can download the binary from release page.
